# Ruby_school-library
Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. This app will let you do that in a well-organized way!


## Getting Started

You need to have Ruby in you operating system to run the irb terminal.
> if you don't have Ruby installed in your machine, you can follow [this link](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-ruby/blob/main/simple-ruby/articles/ruby_installation_instructions.md
) to find instructions for all operating systems.

* To open the `irb` and play around with the code just type `irb` in your terminal and copy/paste the code into your irb.

* Else, fork a copy to your repository and clone it locally:
> `$ git clone https://github.com/TheLuisAbarca/Ruby_school-library/
$ cd Ruby_school-library
$ bundle install`

* Now, run the command ruby filename.rb in your terminal to check if solutions are printed correctly.

* To run test project locate on root directory and run the following code:
> `$ rspec spec`
